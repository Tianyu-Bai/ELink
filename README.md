It provides a mechanically robust and electrically reliable interface between thin-film implanted neural probes and external headstages, with a form factor optimized for freely moving animal studies.[!TIP]Key Innovation: The system integrates a high-density interposer PCB, an anisotropic elastomeric contact interface, and a lightweight pedestal housing into a fully integrated, headstage-ready solution.📊 Quick SpecificationsSpecificationValueChannel Count256 ChannelsTotal Mass~6.4 gInterconnect TypeSolderless Anisotropic ElastomerCompatibilityIntan RHD / Omnetics / Thin-film ProbesHousing Material3D-Printed PEEK / Surgical Grade Resin✨ Key Features⚡ 256-Channel High-Density InterfaceCompact pedestal footprint supporting high-density acquisition without increasing surgical overhead.🔌 Solderless Elastomeric InterconnectUses anisotropic conductive elastomer for repeatable, alignment-tolerant electrical contact.🐭 Optimized for In-Vivo ResearchMinimal mass (6.4g) designed to reduce skull torque in rats and non-human primates.🛠️ Modular & ScalableSeparable housing, PCB, and protective cap for rapid iteration and troubleshooting.🧪 Surgical-Grade DesignTextured sidewalls for superior adhesion with dental cement or UV-curable resin.🧩 System Components<p align="center"><img src="./images/pedestal-system.jpg" alt="PEDAL-256 System Overview" width="680"></p>ComponentDescriptionHousing3D-printed/machined PEEK pedestal for mechanical protection.Interposer PCBHigh-density routing connecting thin-film probes to headstage.Surgical CapProtective cap preserving connector integrity between sessions.📂 Repository StructureBash├── CAD/                  # Mechanical design files
